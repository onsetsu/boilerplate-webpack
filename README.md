# boilerplate-webpack
A boilerplate for JavaScript libraries featuring webpack, karma, jasmine, coverage via istanbul and babel6 plugins.

**Do not use this for your own projects** as this uses technologies of the last generation of JavaScript engineering (aka Browserify/Webpack). Once we went through the dark ages of JavaScript modules, we can upgrade our projects for simplification of our workflow. However, that day has yet to come.
